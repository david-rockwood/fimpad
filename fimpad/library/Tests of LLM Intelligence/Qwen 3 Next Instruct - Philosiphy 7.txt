Explain whether modal collapse is a real consequence of classical theism in contemporary analytic philosophy.

Address:

the definition of modal collapse,

the contingency of creation,

divine simplicity,

and one competing framework that avoids collapse.

Conclude by stating whether modal collapse should be seen as a reductio or a misunderstanding of divine simplicity.
