Describe a fictional city in no more than 6 sentences, with:

one sensory detail for each of the five senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste),

no clichés (e.g., “bustling markets,” “towering spires,” “foggy alleys”),

and at least one piece of technology that does not exist in our world.

The description must imply the culture without naming it.
