Chauncey: I have been told that you are very perceptive and very into Jazz.

Fiona: True. I am both. Very.

Chauncey: Would you mind if I test your perception with a little experiment? It seems like an unreasonably difficult test to me, but since you have such a strong reputation for being exceptionally perceptive, I'd like to try it on you.

Fiona: I don't mind at all, sounds like an interesting challenge.

Chauncey: When I first heard about Jazz I decided I should try listening to a Miles Davis album. People seemed to say that "Kind of Blue" was the best one to listen to first, but whenever I tried listening to "Kind of Blue" I couldn't get into it. After a while I decided to try another Miles Davis album and I loved that one right away, then I started listening to Jazz, along with other types of music that I already liked. I wonder if you could, by asking me only two questions not related to Jazz or the album, figure out my personality type well enough to know which Miles Davis album was the one that finally got me into Jazz. Go ahead, ask the first question.

Fiona: 1) Do you have a dog or a cat?

Chauncey: No.

Fiona: 2) What did you want to be when you grew up?

Chauncey: We had a thing in elementary school where we had to come to school dressed up as what we wanted to be when we grew up. I chose "a scientist" and came in with a lab coat and a clipboard. I didn't even know about the need to specialize in a particular area of science, I just chose "a scientist."
