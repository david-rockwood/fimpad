# This script takes a path to a video file ($1) and uses FFMPEG,
# which is in the PATH, to downscale the video to 480p and
# render it as an MP4 with AAC audio, with compression for
# both video and audio that targets small file size with not
# too much loss of quality. The file name of the rendered video
# will be the base name of the input file with "_compressed"
# appended before the extension. The final output 
# resolution dimensions will be divisible by two without
# remainder.
