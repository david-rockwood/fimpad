One way to get what you want with FIM generation is to simply declare what follows. Try out some examples below:



[[[PREFIX]]]
The following is a list of the 3 most liked Miles Davis songs (song title only):
```
1. [[[100;stop("```\n");temp("0.5");top_p("0.8")]]]
[[[SUFFIX]]]



[[[PREFIX]]]
The following is a two paragraph description of Stoic principles that, if applied, will lead to a more serene existence:
```
[[[400;stop("```\n");temp("0.9");top_p("0.95")]]]
[[[SUFFIX]]]



[[[PREFIX]]]
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# This script takes a path to a video file ($1) and uses FFMPEG,
# which is in the PATH, to downscale the video to 480p and
# render it as a MP4 with AAC audio, with compression for
# both video and audio that targets small file size with not
# too much loss of quality. The file name of the rendered video
# will be the base name of the input file with "_compressed"
# appended before the extension.
[[[400;temp("0.7");top_p("0.95")]]]
echo "The file has been rendered successfully."

[[[SUFFIX]]]
