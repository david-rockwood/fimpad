FIMpad Help
===========

FIMpad now focuses solely on fill-in-the-middle (FIM) generation. Insert a triple-bracket marker like `[[[120]]]` anywhere in your document to stream up to that many tokens. When the marker is processed, it will be removed and replaced by generated text.

Use `[[[prefix]]]` and `[[[suffix]]]` tags to narrow what context is sent to the model for FIM generation:
- Text between `[[[prefix]]]` and the FIM marker is used as the prefix.
- Text between the marker and the next `[[[suffix]]]` (or the end of the file) is used as the suffix.

Press **Ctrl+Enter** to generate with the marker at your cursor. Use **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to repeat the last FIM marker at the cursor position.

For more details, see the README in the repository.
